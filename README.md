# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🏠 About the Project
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that mimics the core features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed as a hands-on learning experience to simulate the planning, development, and deployment of a real-world, scalable booking system. This project gives learners the opportunity to apply backend development principles, database design, API architecture, and DevOps practices in a collaborative team setting.

## 🧩 Project Highlights

### 🔄 GitHub Repository Management
Structure and manage the repository using Git branching strategies, pull requests, and issues.

### 🧱 Database Design
Plan a normalized relational database schema including entities like users, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### 🔐 API Security
Protect endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, role-based access).

### 🚀 CI/CD Integration
Automate testing and deployment using Docker and GitHub Actions to ensure fast and reliable delivery.

### 🎯 Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project is designed to mirror the essential features of a real-world booking platform. Below is a breakdown of the core functionalities that bring the application to life:

1. User Management
This feature allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It includes user authentication, password encryption, and role-based access control for both hosts and guests.

2. Property Management
Hosts can list their properties, including details like location, images, pricing, and availability. This module ensures that property data is organized, editable, and linked to the host’s account.

3. Search & Filter System
Guests can search for available properties based on criteria like location, price, dates, and amenities. This feature improves the user experience by allowing quick access to relevant listings.

4. Booking System
Users can book properties for specific dates, view their booking history, and receive confirmation details. The system handles availability checks, conflict resolution, and payment logic.

5. Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature promotes trust and transparency, helping future users make informed decisions.

6. Messaging System
Hosts and guests can communicate through an in-app messaging platform. This allows for better coordination and clarifies booking or property-related concerns.

7. Admin Dashboard
An admin role can manage users, monitor listings, and enforce platform policies. This ensures system-wide oversight and operational integrity.

8. Security Features
All sensitive endpoints are protected through authentication mechanisms such as JWT tokens. Role-based access and secure password storage are also implemented to ensure user data protection.

9. Mobile Responsiveness
The application’s UI is designed to be fully responsive across devices, ensuring accessibility whether on desktop or mobile.
