# Airbnb Clone Project

## üè† About the Project
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that mimics the core features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed as a hands-on learning experience to simulate the planning, development, and deployment of a real-world, scalable booking system. This project gives learners the opportunity to apply backend development principles, database design, API architecture, and DevOps practices in a collaborative team setting.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By working on this project, you will:

- Master collaborative development workflows using Git and GitHub.
- Design and implement backend systems with Django and MySQL.
- Understand and apply relational database modeling concepts.
- Develop RESTful and GraphQL APIs with secure authentication and authorization.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker.
- Document project features, technologies, and development process using Markdown.
- Learn to work effectively in a team by assigning and managing roles.

## üß© Project Highlights

### üîÑ GitHub Repository Management
Structure and manage the repository using Git branching strategies, pull requests, and issues.

### üß± Database Design
Plan a normalized relational database schema including entities like users, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### üîê API Security
Protect endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, role-based access).

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying code. In the context of this Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD ensures that new code changes are continuously integrated, tested for reliability, and automatically deployed to the server without manual intervention.

Implementing CI/CD pipelines improves collaboration, accelerates delivery, and reduces the risk of introducing bugs during deployment. It also helps maintain code quality and system stability as the application grows.

Tools commonly used in this project‚Äôs CI/CD pipeline include:
GitHub Actions ‚Äì For automating workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment directly from GitHub.
Docker ‚Äì To containerize the application, making it easy to deploy across different environments.
Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean ‚Äì For cloud deployment and environment management.
pytest / unittest ‚Äì For automated backend testing before deployment.

### üéØ Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project is designed to mirror the essential features of a real-world booking platform. Below is a breakdown of the core functionalities that bring the application to life:

1. User Management
This feature allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It includes user authentication, password encryption, and role-based access control for both hosts and guests.

2. Property Management
Hosts can list their properties, including details like location, images, pricing, and availability. This module ensures that property data is organized, editable, and linked to the host‚Äôs account.

3. Search & Filter System
Guests can search for available properties based on criteria like location, price, dates, and amenities. This feature improves the user experience by allowing quick access to relevant listings.

4. Booking System
Users can book properties for specific dates, view their booking history, and receive confirmation details. The system handles availability checks, conflict resolution, and payment logic.

5. Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature promotes trust and transparency, helping future users make informed decisions.

6. Messaging System
Hosts and guests can communicate through an in-app messaging platform. This allows for better coordination and clarifies booking or property-related concerns.

7. Admin Dashboard
An admin role can manage users, monitor listings, and enforce platform policies. This ensures system-wide oversight and operational integrity.

8. Security Features
All sensitive endpoints are protected through authentication mechanisms such as JWT tokens. Role-based access and secure password storage are also implemented to ensure user data protection.

9. Mobile Responsiveness
The application‚Äôs UI is designed to be fully responsive across devices, ensuring accessibility whether on desktop or mobile.
